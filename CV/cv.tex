\section{Personal Summary}
{I would describe myself as a highly motivated and hardworking individual, a quick learner and enjoy working as part of a team. I am also quite friendly and reliable and & enjoy meeting new people. Above all I respect peoples beliefs, decisions and opinions. As much as I enjoy hard work, taking the opportunity to help is always something I will do. I tend to take instructions quite well, however shall the need arise I can use my own initiative. I am as fluent with Irish as with English this is due to the fact I have been speaking it since I was 4 years old.}

    The qualifications I currently hold are eight GCSEs all C grade or above and three A-levels. These were done in Colaiste Feirste where all my studies had been taught and learnt in the Irish language upon which i am a fluent speaker. This shows that as I have gone to a university which has been a completely different experience for me learning education in English which I'm also fluent in and to exceed really shows my value to overcome and adapt to new situations.
